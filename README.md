[Synopsis]

OCI Fortigate HA script is an automation for Fortigate Active/Passive design. 
The script will monitor the active Fortigate and will fail to Passive Fortigate when trigger condition is met.
During the failover, Public IP (Floating) is moved from Active Fortigate to Passive Fortigate. Also, 
routetable for inside subnets changed to next-hop (trust or inside) such that they follow the Active Fortigate. 
This assures that traffic both directions inbound and outbound flows through the same Firewall.


[Pre-requisites]

-The script should be run on worker node in OCI environment. Worker node will linux instance (eg. ubuntu) and python2.7 installed. Also, python libraries listed should be installed.
-From the worker node, OCI environment needs to be reachable and also Fortigate Eth0 interfaces need to be reachable. 
-Fortigates will have Floating Public IP (Reserved) between the instances. So while deploying Fortigates "Public IP" select as none in OCI.
-Create a PublicIP in OCI  IPReservation. Active Fortigate Eth0 should be assigned the Floating Public IP.. 

[Example]

		      Floating Public IP             <<--- IPReservation in shared Network

	 |                            |
----------                    ----------
Fortigate1                    Fortigate2
----------                    ----------
   |                            |
	 |Eth1                        |Eth1
	 |                            |          
   ------------------------------

	        Server Subnet
     
Server Subnet RouteTable will point to Fortigate which is Active meaning which has public IP attached to it. When the public IP swiches, the RouteTable will switch to other Fortigate as well.


***The script will work for the setup as described above. The script should be consumed as reference automation which would work in environment mentioned in the documentation and should not be considered as a product.
